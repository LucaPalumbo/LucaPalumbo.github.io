# Exposition - Idek CTF 2025 Writeup

## Challenge Overview

**Challenge Name:** Exposition  
**CTF:** Idek CTF 2025  
**Category:** Mobile/React Native  


The challenge presented us with a React Native application consisting of a simple physics-based interface. Users could input text that would spawn as colored rectangles in a physics simulation area, where these rectangles could move and collide with each other.

## Initial Analysis

### Application Interface

The app features a minimal interface with:
- A large physics simulation area (gray background with blue dotted border)
- An input field at the bottom with the instruction "Type text and press enter to create floating blocks!"
- When text is entered, it creates colored rectangular blocks that can move and interact within the simulation area

*The application showing three blocks created from inputs "The", "is", and "flag"*

### First Steps - Static Analysis

Since only an APK file was provided, I began with static analysis using JADX to decompile the application.

The first important file I examined was `com.exposition.MainApplication`:

```java
package com.exposition;
import android.app.Application;
import android.content.Context;
import com.facebook.react.PackageList;
import com.facebook.react.ReactApplication;
import com.facebook.react.ReactHost;
import com.facebook.react.ReactNativeApplicationEntryPoint;
import com.facebook.react.ReactNativeHost;
import com.facebook.react.ReactPackage;
import com.facebook.react.defaults.DefaultReactHost;
import com.facebook.react.defaults.DefaultReactNativeHost;
// ... [truncated for brevity]

public final class MainApplication extends Application implements ReactApplication {
    private final ReactNativeHost reactNativeHost = new DefaultReactNativeHost(this) {
        private final boolean isHermesEnabled;
        private final boolean isNewArchEnabled;
        
        @Override
        public boolean getUseDeveloperSupport() {
            return false;
        }
        
        // ... additional React Native configuration
    };
    
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        ReactNativeApplicationEntryPoint.loadReactNative(this);
    }
}
```

This confirmed that we were dealing with a React Native application, as evidenced by:
- Multiple imports from `com.facebook.react` packages
- Implementation of `ReactApplication` interface  
- References to React Native components like `ReactNativeHost` and `ReactPackage`

## Deep Dive - React Native Reverse Engineering

### Learning About React Native Architecture

Since I had never reversed a React Native application before, I started researching the architecture and reverse engineering techniques specific to this framework.

I discovered a very helpful blog post: [Reverse Engineering and Instrumenting React Native Apps](https://pilfer.github.io/mobile-reverse-engineering/react-native/reverse-engineering-and-instrumenting-react-native-apps/)


### Locating the JavaScript Bundle

Following the guide, I found that the React Native code was contained in:
```
resources/assets/index.android.bundle
```

However, when I tried to examine this file, I encountered an obstacle:

```bash
feld@feld-ZenBook:~/Documents/ctf/idek2025/exposition/attachments/app-jadx/resources/assets$ file index.android.bundle 
index.android.bundle: Hermes JavaScript bytecode, version 96
```

The file wasn't plain JavaScript as I expected, but rather **Hermes JavaScript bytecode** - a specific bytecode format used by React Native applications when the Hermes JavaScript engine is enabled (which we had confirmed from the MainApplication code: `isHermesEnabled = true`).

### The Hermes Challenge

This presented a significant challenge because Hermes bytecode is not human-readable like regular JavaScript. The bytecode is a compiled, optimized format that requires special tools to decompile back into readable JavaScript.

### Decompiling Hermes Bytecode

More research led me to discover [hermes-dec](https://github.com/P1sec/hermes-dec), a decompiler specifically designed for Hermes JavaScript bytecode. This tool can convert the bytecode back into readable JavaScript.

I used the decompiler on the bundle:

```bash
hbc-decompiler assets/index.android.bundle output.js
```

The decompilation was successful, but it produced a **massive** JavaScript file. React Native bundles typically contain not just the application code, but also the entire React Native framework, third-party libraries, and all dependencies bundled together into a single file.

### Analyzing the Decompiled Output

With the decompiled JavaScript in hand, I now faced the challenge of finding the relevant application code within thousands of lines of framework and library code.

The decompiled file was **massive** - over 200,000 lines of heavily obfuscated JavaScript.

### Finding the Application Logic

To locate the relevant code, I used a simple but effective technique: **searching for strings visible in the UI**. 

I searched for the text `"Type something and press enter"` which was visible in the app interface, and this led me to find the core application logic.

Here's the relevant section I discovered:

```javascript
r17 = _closure1_slot5;
r18 = r17.TextInput;
r17 = {};
r24 = _closure1_slot10;
r24 = r24.inputBox;
r17['style'] = r24;
r24 = 'Type something and press enter...';
r17['placeholder'] = r24;
r17['value'] = r23;
r17['onChangeText'] = r22;
[...]
```

The next ~1000 lines contain the main application code.

### The Flag Validation Logic

More importantly, I found what appeared to be flag validation code. The decompiled JavaScript contained several key elements:

1. **Flag Format Validation**: The code checks for the standard CTF flag format:
   - Must start with `'idek{'`
   - Must end with `'}'`
   - The content between must match a specific pattern: `/^[a-zA-Z0-9_]{61}$/`

2. **Flag Structure**: The validation revealed the flag structure:
   - Total length: 61 characters (excluding the `idek{` and `}` wrapper)
   - Position 16 must be `'_'`
   - Position 33 must be `'_'`
   - This creates a three-part structure: `PART1_PART2_PART3`
   - Part 1: 16 characters (positions 0-15)
   - Part 2: 16 characters (positions 17-32)  
   - Part 3: 27 characters (positions 34-60)

3. **Three Validation Functions**: The code contained three separate validation methods, one for each part of the flag:
   - 1: Validates the first 16 characters
   - 2: Validates the middle 16 characters  
   - 3: Validates the final 27 characters

4. **Trigger Condition**: There's special logic that activates when the last three text blocks created spell out `['The', 'flag', 'is']` in that exact order


## Reverse Engineering the Flag Parts

Now came the challenging part: understanding how each of the three validation functions worked and what they expected as input.

### Part 1: The Date-Hash-XOR Challenge

The first part of the flag (16 characters) used a particularly interesting validation approach:

```javascript
r10 = r10.toString;
r1 = 10;
r10 = r10.bind(r6)(r1);
r6 = r10.padStart;
r5 = 2;
r1 = '0';
r10 = r6.bind(r10)(r5, r1);
// ... more date manipulation ...
r11 = r2.Date;
r1 = '2025-';
r12 = r1 + r10;
r1 = '-';
r1 = r12 + r1;
r19 = r1 + r10;
// Creates date string like "2025-00-00"
r10 = r11.prototype;
r10 = Object.create(r10, {constructor: {value: r11}});
r20 = r10;
r1 = new r20[r11](r19, r18);
r10 = r1 instanceof Object ? r1 : r10;
r1 = r10.toISOString;
r1 = r1.bind(r10)();
r10 = r6.bind(r9)(r1);
```

The validation works as follows:

1. **Date Object Creation**: A JavaScript Date object is created with the string `"2025-00-00"` - which is technically invalid but JavaScript handles it gracefully
2. **Date Normalization**: The invalid date gets normalized to `"2024-11-30T00:00:00.000Z"` when `toISOString()` is called (JavaScript date handling can be quite quirky)
3. **SHA-256 Hashing**: This normalized date string gets hashed with SHA-256
4. **XOR Validation**: The first part of the input flag is XORed against a hardcoded key
5. **Comparison**: If the XOR result matches the SHA-256 hash, the first part passes validation

The relevant XOR validation code:
```javascript
r1 = [207, 143, 244, 109, 98, 219, 179, 20, 93, 64, 118, 3, 154, 106, 77, 248, 135, 143, 226, 26, 102, 102, 88, 231, 123, 239, 122, 77, 46, 235, 13, 227];
// ... XOR operations with this hardcoded key
r6 = r8.charCodeAt;
r6 = r6.bind(r8)(r2);
r4 = _closure6_slot1;
r4 = r4[r7];
r4 = r6 ^ r4;
r1 = r5 === r4;
```

### Inverting Part 1 Validation

This validation was straightforward to reverse since it's a simple XOR operation. I wrote a Python script to invert the process:

```python
import hashlib
from pwn import xor

key = [207, 143, 244, 109, 98, 219, 179, 20, 93, 64, 118, 3, 154, 106, 77, 248, 135, 143, 226, 26, 102, 102, 88, 231, 123, 239, 122, 77, 46, 235, 13, 227]
xor_key = bytes(key)
print("xor_key", xor_key)

date_iso = "2024-11-30T00:00:00.000Z"
sha256_hash = hashlib.sha256(date_iso.encode()).digest()
date_iso_hashs = sha256_hash
print("-----")

xored = xor(date_iso_hashs, xor_key)
print(f"xored\t {xored}")

part = ''
for i in range(0, len(xored), 2):
    part += chr(xored[i])
print(part)
print(part[::-1])
```

This gave me the first 16 characters of the flag.

### Part 2: The Lights Out Game Challenge

The second part of the flag validation was much more creative - it implemented a **Lights Out** puzzle game!

The relevant JavaScript code initialized two 8Ã—8 grids:

```javascript
r3 = new Array(33);
r1 = [2, 2];
r3[0] = r1;
r1 = [4, 0];
r3[1] = r1;
r1 = [2, 5];
r3[2] = r1;
// ... more grid initialization coordinates ...

r14 = new Array(36);
r1 = [7, 4];
r14[0] = r1;
r1 = [2, 6];
r14[1] = r1;
// ... second grid coordinates ...
```

The validation works as follows:

1. **Grid Setup**: Two 8Ã—8 grids are initialized with specific positions set to 1, others to 0
2. **Lights Out Rules**: Each "move" flips a cell and its orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right)
3. **Goal**: Find the sequence of moves that makes all cells in the grid equal to 0
4. **Flag Encoding**: The solution pattern encodes the flag characters - each row of moves represents one byte/character

### Solving the Lights Out Puzzle

This is essentially a linear algebra problem over GF(2) (binary field). I used Gaussian elimination to solve it:

```python
import numpy as np

def index(r, c):
    return r * 8 + c

def neighbors(r, c):
    for dr, dc in [(0,0), (-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]:
        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
        if 0 <= nr < 8 and 0 <= nc < 8:
            yield index(nr, nc)

# Build the effect matrix A
A = np.zeros((64, 64), dtype=np.uint8)
for r in range(8):
    for c in range(8):
        i = index(r, c)
        for j in neighbors(r, c):
            A[j, i] = 1  # column i = effect of clicking position i

# Initial state (first grid)
grid = [
    [1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0],
    [1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1],
    [1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0],
    [1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0],
    [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
    [1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1],
    [1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1],
    [1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1]
]

b = np.array([bit for row in grid for bit in row], dtype=np.uint8)

# Gaussian elimination mod 2
def gauss_mod2(A, b):
    A = A.copy()
    b = b.copy()
    n = len(b)
    
    for col in range(n):
        pivot = None
        for row in range(col, n):
            if A[row, col]:
                pivot = row
                break
        
        if pivot is None:
            continue  # null column
            
        if pivot != col:
            A[[col, pivot]] = A[[pivot, col]]
            b[[col, pivot]] = b[[pivot, col]]
        
        for row in range(n):
            if row != col and A[row, col]:
                A[row] ^= A[col]
                b[row] ^= b[col]
    
    return b

solution = gauss_mod2(A, b)

# Convert solution to characters
for r in range(8):
    number = int(''.join(str(solution[index(r, c)]) for c in range(8)), 2)
    print(chr(number), end='')
```

By changing the initial grid matrix, this same script could solve for the second set of 8 characters in Part 2.

### Part 3: RC4 Cryptography with Physics Parameters

The final part of the flag (27 characters) used RC4 encryption - the encryption key was derived from the physics simulation parameters used by the app!

Looking at the JavaScript code, I found the relevant section:

```javascript
r7 = _closure2_slot8;
r7 = r7.current;
r19 = r7.gravity;
r7 = _closure2_slot8;
r7 = r7.current;
r18 = r7.airResistance;
r7 = _closure2_slot8;
r7 = r7.current;
r17 = r7.bounceDamping;
r7 = _closure2_slot8;
r7 = r7.current;
r16 = r7.collisionDamping;
r6 = _closure2_slot8;
r6 = r6.current;
r15 = r6.zeroClampThreshold;
r6 = r2.HermesInternal;
r7 = r6.concat;
r20 = '';
r10 = r20[r7](r19, r18, r17, r16, r15, r14);
```

And the ciphertext comparison:
```javascript
r3 = function(a0, a1) { // Environment: r3
    r1 = [134, 145, 231, 193, 40, 196, 78, 177, 206, 34, 168, 148, 66, 43, 66, 136, 194, 158, 195, 255, 243, 123, 190, 218, 173, 28, 3];
    r0 = a1;
    r1 = r1[r0];
    r0 = a0;
    r0 = r0 === r1;
    return r0;
};
```

The validation works by:
1. **Key Generation**: Concatenating physics parameters: gravity + airResistance + bounceDamping + collisionDamping + zeroClampThreshold
2. **RC4 Encryption**: Using the concatenated string as the RC4 key
3. **Comparison**: The input flag part is encrypted and compared against the hardcoded ciphertext array

### Solving the RC4 Challenge

I implemented an RC4 decryption function and used the physics parameters as the key:

```python
def rc4_decrypt(ciphertext, key):
    """
    Standard RC4 implementation for decryption
    """
    # Key Scheduling Algorithm (KSA)
    S = list(range(256))
    j = 0
    for i in range(256):
        j = (j + S[i] + key[i % len(key)]) % 256
        S[i], S[j] = S[j], S[i]
    
    # Pseudo-Random Generation Algorithm (PRGA)
    i = j = 0
    plaintext = []
    for byte in ciphertext:
        i = (i + 1) % 256
        j = (j + S[i]) % 256
        S[i], S[j] = S[j], S[i]
        keystream_byte = S[(S[i] + S[j]) % 256]
        plaintext_byte = byte ^ keystream_byte
        plaintext.append(plaintext_byte)
    
    return bytes(plaintext)

# Physics parameters from the app
gravity = 0.15
airResistance = 0.996
bounceDamping = 0.7
collisionDamping = 0.8
zeroClampThreshold = 0.005

# Build key by concatenating parameters (as done by HermesInternal.concat)
key_string = f"{gravity}{airResistance}{bounceDamping}{collisionDamping}{zeroClampThreshold}"
print(f"Key string: {key_string}")

# Encode key (as done by TextEncoder in JavaScript)
key_bytes = key_string.encode('utf-8')
print(f"Key bytes: {key_bytes}")

# Hardcoded ciphertext from JavaScript
ciphertext = [134, 145, 231, 193, 40, 196, 78, 177, 206, 34, 168, 148, 66, 43, 66, 136, 194, 158, 195, 255, 243, 123, 190, 218, 173, 28, 3]

# Decrypt
try:
    decrypted = rc4_decrypt(ciphertext, key_bytes)
    print(f"Decrypted as string: {decrypted.decode('utf-8', errors='ignore')}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error during decryption: {e}")
```

This approach successfully revealed the final 27 characters of the flag by reversing the RC4 encryption using the physics parameters as the decryption key.

## Solution

Combining all three parts, the complete flag was:

```
idek{d3spit3_th3_nam3_No_Expo_was_Used_in_the_cr34t10n_of_7hi5_4pp}
```


The flag itself is a clever reference to the challenge name "Exposition" - despite the name, no actual Expo (React Native development framework) was used in creating the app!

## Lessons Learned

This challenge was an excellent introduction to React Native reverse engineering and taught several valuable techniques:

### Technical Skills Gained

**Hermes Bytecode Analysis**: Learning to identify and decompile Hermes JavaScript bytecode using tools like `hermes-dec`

### JavaScript Quirks

A fun side discovery was JavaScript's bizarre date handling behavior. The invalid date `"2025-00-00"` automatically normalizing to `"2024-11-30T00:00:00.000Z"` is exactly the kind of quirk that makes JavaScript both fascinating and frustrating. There's actually a [hilarious quiz about JavaScript date oddities](https://jsdate.wtf/) that demonstrates just how unpredictable the Date object can be!

## Flag
